main.py, story.py, record_audio.py and the html folder need to be on the robot to run correctly.
The html folder has to have this path: ~/.local/share/PackageManager/apps/.lastUploadedChoregrapheBehavior/html  or it doesn't work for some reason....

naoqi_camera should prefereably run on a computer though.
